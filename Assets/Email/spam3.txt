URGENT HELP DISTRIBUTE $15MILLION TO CHARITY

I am Mr Peter Attah, the President of TOMOBA OIL LIMITED. Presently, I am in the hospital and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations.

Contact me via e-mail: peterattah2007@yahoo.co.uk if this proposal is acceptable to you.
May the good Lord bless you and your family.
Mr Peter Attah
